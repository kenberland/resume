	<div class="section intro">
	  <p>I'm a mentor and an engineering leader by example. I believe that engineering managers need to be engineering leaders as well. Leaders roll up their sleeves and demonstrate success. As teams grow, leaders can't write code 100% of the time, but they can't do it 0% of the time either. I work to find the right balance, writing code and solving problems side-by-side with my team, gaining their confidence and really understanding the challenges. &quot;Boots on the ground&quot; engineering allows me to be an effective executive, planning for growth and understanding our products and operations.</p>
	  <p>I love Ruby, Rails, Puppet, and AWS. I work with these tools and JavaScript every day and have also worked extensively with Go, Java, PHP, C, and Perl.</p>
